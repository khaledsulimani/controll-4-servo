project for controll 4 servo at one time
  
first we try to make the circut in tinkercad and simulate it

  and then work in real life
    
    so when we start we have to know that servo have 3 pin 

      1-black=gnd

        2-red=vin or power

          3-yellow=signal

            so we will use breadborad for connect all gnd and vin and all sginal wire to the arduino and we will take power source from power bank
